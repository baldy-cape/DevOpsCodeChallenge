Task 1: Automate the creation of the following resources
● A VPC
○ A private subnet
○ A public subnet
● An IAM role with S3 access
● An EC2 instance with the previously created role attached, inside the private
subnet of the created VPC
● An EC2 instance with no role attached, inside the public subnet of the
created VPC
○ Bootstrap this instance with NGINX
● A load balancer in the public subnet of the created VPC
○ Targeting the private EC2 instance
● A security group
○ Attached to the created EC2 instances

Task 2: Build a CI/CD pipeline to run your automation
Using a CI/CD tool provider of your choice, create a pipeline which will run the
automation configured in Task 1.
Requirements of this pipeline are as follows:
1. It should run only if commits have been pushed to the master branch
2. Multiple runs should not result in duplicated resources
3. Any automation commands that fail should cause the build to fail

Bonus Task:
In order to showcase your approach to solving a less defined problem take a look at
the following exercise.
We want to scalably run a docker container which contains Nginx, design the
infrastructure which will fulfill this and provide the IaC in the same repository as the
tasks above.
